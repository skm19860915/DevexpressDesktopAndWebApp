                <p>  Costa Rica is more than a vacation destination, it is an interactive   sensory experience. The country has an intense array of attractions –   majestic volcanoes, misty cloud forests, stunning river valleys, and   hundreds of beaches along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts.Imagine   yourself on a surfboard or yoga mat, descending bat-filled caves or   climbing misty volcanic peaks, hiking, biking or zip-lining – your only   limit is your return date (and we can most certainly extend that!).   Experience “glamping” on Isla Chiquita or get the celebrity treatment   with world-class service at Hotel Villa Caletas, a beach and mountain   hotel perfect for romantic moments and family adventures in the Jaco   area, or get lost in the Costa Rican jungle at the Lost Iguana Resort   &amp; Spa, a stunning nature inspired hotel located within 120 acres of   preserved rain forest, or stay at Nayara Springs, an ultra-exclusive   adults only boutique resort and enjoy the breathtaking natural beauty   and underground mineral thermal springs in the Arenal Volcano National   Park, host to one of the world’s highest concentration of tropical   plants and wildlife.  </p>

                <p>  Belize – “Mother Nature’s Best Kept Secret”. Lush tropical rain  forests,  pristine beaches, diverse flora and fauna, and the longest  barrier reef  in the Western Hemisphere make Belize the perfect vacation  destination  for everyone. Belize is home to the famous “Great Blue  Hole”, you simply  must snorkel and dive while here! As the cradle of  the ancient Maya  Civilization, Belize has literally more Maya Ruins per  square mile than  any other country. In short, Belize is the  destination for adventure  travel. Spend a couple nights at a remote  jungle lodge and maybe catch a  glimpse of a passing tapir or jaguar or  on a private island, Cayo  Espanto or canoe down the Macal, Sitee and  Belize Rivers.  </p>
